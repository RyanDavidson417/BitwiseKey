This is a fully working, but very early prototype of the game. Everything that I have in the game is fully operational and free of major issues. Below I'll outline the major features of the game and how to play it, but feel free to check out the broader project ReadMe at [The Projects GitHub](https://github.com/RyanDavidson417/BitwiseKey/blob/65886f0a4b46e7d4770ca43fa91dfa339fca762f/README.md) to view my plans for upcoming features.

When the player spawns, two collectibles will each spawn at one of four random points in the map. Your goal is to find and collect them as quickly as possible. You can move around with either WASD or the Arrow keys. When you find a powerup you can collect it by getting close enough to it and pressing [E]. The Green X ray vision will allow you to pass through walls in the maze that you couldn't before, and the blue invisibility can be activated by pressing [Q] (provided you have sufficient charge). 

Unfortunately, I've yet to implement menus and thus a way to exit the game. At any point when you're done playing press alt+f4 to exit out of it. 

Otherwise, enjoy the starting foundation of my upcoming game, and feel free to reach out over [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-davidson-dev/) or Email (Ryan.davidson.417@gmail.com) with any feedback
